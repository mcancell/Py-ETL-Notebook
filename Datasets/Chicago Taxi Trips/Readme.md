# Data Office Technical Skills Assessment

This test is designed to give us a better understanding of how our candidates leverage their technical skills to answer business questions and communicate findings.

To complete the assignment, you will work with the following BigQuery public dataset:

**Chicago Taxi Trips dataset**:  
`bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`

---

## Part I

1. **SQL Analysis**  
    Submit your SQL code showing how you approached the data to answer the following questions. Note that a query that returns only the requested answers (and no additional data) is preferred over one requiring export or manipulation in Excel.  
    
    a. Which three distinct taxi companies had the largest month-over-month increase in trips, and what were those months and trip amounts?  
    b. Which three distinct taxi companies had the largest month-over-month decrease in fare-per-mile, and what were those months and fare-per-mile values?  

2. **Executive Summary**  
    Submit an executive summary/report of your findings, clearly answering the questions above.

## Part II

This portion of the assignment gives candidates creative freedom to explore the dataset in any way they choose. There are no tricks hereâ€”this is simply meant to assess your ability to unearth insights and leverage visualizations to tell a story.

3. **Additional Analysis**  
    Considering the context of the questions from Part I, conduct an additional analysis using the same dataset and design a report that provides at least one additional insight, trend, or other relevant detail that piques your interest.  

    This report should:  
    - Clearly explain the value or potential use of that observation for someone interested in the answers to the questions above.  
    - Include at least one visualization.
